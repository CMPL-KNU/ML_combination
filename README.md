This is the repository of code for paper "Machine Learning Prediction Models for Solid Electrolytes based on Lattice Dynamics Properties"


This codes are based on Python3, and require to install:
  - scikit-learn
  - Pandas with openpyxl
  - tqdm

Explanation
  - 
- LR : Logistic regression code (classification) \
  \
  This directory contains codes to train Logistic regression models.\
  Set the number of features through "Logistic_config.ini" file.\
  All combinations of the number of features trains. following command to run:\
  python main.py 
  
- RF : Random forest regression code (regression) \
  \
  This directory contains codes to train Random forest regression models.\
  Set the initial conditions in the main python code "SE_code_RF_2024.py"\
  , and following command to run:\
  python SE_code_RF_2024.py


We provide datasets containing information on ionic conductivity, as well as the results generated by LR and RF models.
